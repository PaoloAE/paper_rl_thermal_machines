# RL_thermal_machines
Reinforcement-learning of optimal cycles in quantum thermal machines.

## Getting started
To get started, open the ```jupyter``` folder. All notebooks, expect for ```paper_plots_from_data.ipynb```, allow to train a specific quantum thermal machine. The training and system parameters in the notebooks correspond to the ones used in the manuscript. The ```paper_plots_from_data.ipynb``` notebook produces the plots of the manuscript from training data.
